Title: Happy Pride Month y’all!



Everyone should be able to find community in the tech space, and we wanted to share some fantastic groups that you might be interested in connecting with if you’re part of the LGBTQ community. 
Lesbians Who Tech – This organization not only brings together the LGTBQ community but welcomes allies to further their mission to create visibility, get more of the community in technology, and connect folx with other groups and companies doing great work. Additionally, they put on a yearly Pride Summit that has free components! 
LGBT Tech – A great organization focused on research, programs, resources, and policies specifically for those in the tech industry. Check out their programs Power On and PATHS to get involved or receive support.  
Start Out – If you’re an entrepreneur and identify as LGBTQ, this group might be perfect for you! They focus on increasing the “number, diversity, and impact of LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs and amplify the stories to drive the economic empowerment of the community.” Additionally, they put together events all around the United States in various cities to network or demo solutions! 
Trans*H4CK – This organization is solely focused on barriers faced by trans, gender non-conforming, and non-binary people, such as unemployment, financial stability, homelessness, and discrimination. 
Out In Tech – The purpose of this organization is to unite the LGBTQ+ community by “creating opportunities for members to advance their careers, grow their networks, and leverage tech for social change.” Out In Tech offers various events and has chapters from London to New York City. 
There are many more groups and organizations that support the LGBTQ community within the tech industry. Some tech companies have Affinity Groups or Employee Resource Groups (ERG’s) for their LGBTQ community, such as Microsoft’s GLEAM or Pride at Google.
