Title: New Python and Data Analysis Workshops



We’re delighted to introduce two new workshops, Python Sets and Data Visualization with Google Sheets, from Treehouse instructor AJ Tran!
Python Sets
This 95-minute workshop covers the basics of a data structure in Python called a set. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements called members.

Developers often use sets like a Venn Diagram to compare and contrast the membership of elements in two or more collections.

Throughout the workshop, students learn to create and manipulate sets and perform common set operations, as well as: 
When to use sets instead of lists or dictionariesTesting for membership of elements in a Python setIdentifying the relationship between two Python setsFinding the union, intersection, difference, & symmetric difference of two or more Python sets
Data Visualization with Google Sheets
Google Sheets is an excellent tool for telling stories with data! In this 42-minute data analysis workshop, students explore five different ways to visualize data with Google Sheets and ultimately improve the story they’re trying to tell to stakeholders.

Students practice alongside the instructor making column and bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and geographic charts using real-world, global datasets while gaining insight into the data with visualizations. The workshop also identifies ways to create alternative texts to make charts more accessible for screen reader users.
