Title: Why Choose Tech?



If you’re exploring your career options you may feel overwhelmed by the possibilities. Which is right for you? What do you want out of a career? What don’t you want? These are all questions you ask yourself when contemplating your future. 
The tech industry is undoubtedly somewhere on your list as it is fast-growing and in high demand. 
Here are some reasons you should consider a career in the tech industry and start studying with Treehouse. 
Job Security
As the tech industry continues to grow, the demand for workers with technical skills grows with it. Tech leaders are in need of workers with desired technical skillsets like software development, data analytics, and cyber security. 
In December 2021, Glassdoor released a report of the 50 best jobs in America for the year 2022. Out of these 50, 21 of those jobs are tech-related. The Bureau of Labor Statistics claims the computer and information technology field is the fastest growing compared to other occupations.
This means that there is no shortage of job opportunities in the tech industry. They predict that 667,600 jobs will be created in the field between 2020-2030. 
Endless Possibilities 
A career in tech can lead you to many exciting opportunities.
For example, if you consider yourself to be more artistically inclined, you may consider learning about digital or UX design. If you are numbers-driven, data analysis may be right for you. There is no limit to what you can do with a background in tech. 
Ever wonder how Snapchat and Instagram use fascial detection to create filters? Developers use Python. NASA uses python for research, and 21% of Facebook’s infrastructure codebase is Python. 
Python is just one of the thousands of coding languages out there. While many exist, the most popular ones are Python, JavaScript, C++, Ruby, PHP, and Swift. 
A career in tech doesn’t necessarily mean you have to learn how to code. Web development/desgin, digital marketers, and sales workers are some roles that use technology every day. 
Financial Stability 
Financial freedom could be a big reason to consider a career in tech depending on if money is something that motivates you. Financial stability means you can live a comfortable life without worrying about a financial impact. 
The top-paying industries right now are healthcare, financial, and tech. Depending on their state, workers in the tech sector make between 20%-80% more than the average salary of their state. The average entry-level app developer makes a $78k salary, while a senior front-end developer is $113k. Of course, it’ll take some time to get there but nothing you can’t handle.
You Don’t Need A College Degree
While college is certainly a popular choice for most high-school graduates, 66.2% of graduates went to college in 2019, it may not be necessary for the tech industry. In 2017, 49% of IT job postings did not require a 4-year bachelor’s degree. 
The reason many job descriptions require college degrees is because it shows you are hungry to learn and can achieve a long-term goal. But college isn’t the only way to showcase that.
Having technical skills and getting a certification in platforms and software like Salesforce, Google Ads, and of course, Treehouse, can show hiring managers you’re willing to learn, and that you have the skills they are looking for.  
A Treehouse Techdegree could be your ticket into the tech world. The program includes video courses, quizzes, and coding challenges that will help you along your coding journey.
