How to Complete This Code Adventure! 🚀
You’ve been tasked to create a card component for a travel website. The designer for the company already created some mockups for you. Your challenge is to recreate the provided designs using HTML & CSS.
The Challenge
The provided mockups are for mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px) sized screens. You’ll want to be coding this project using the mobile-first approach so you’ll want to start creating the mobile layout and using media queries to make the styling behave differently when the screen size gets at a certain point.
