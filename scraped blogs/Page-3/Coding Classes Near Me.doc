Top Online Coding Classes
Treehouse
Treehouse is an online coding school where you can subscribe to a variety of coding courses at any level. You can take courses one at a time from the courses library, or you can do an online boot camp (called a Techdegree at Treehouse), which takes about 3-9 months to complete.
The Treehouse tech degrees give you a competitive edge when applying for jobs. The Techdegrees provide you with a portfolio you can use in interviews. Also, just doing one or two courses can be a great way to brush up your skills.
The live instruction makes Treehouse different from typical online coding schools. You can take courses directly on the site, then if you run into any problems you can interact with the community on the Treehouse slack. Our instructors are here to help you solve the problems you might encounter while studying at Treehouse. 
The materials are available online, so you can study the material at your own pace. You can study quickly or slowly depending on the other demands in your life. As well, you can pause your study if you ever need to do something else for a couple of months.
Treehouse is the best online coding boot camp available today. You should sign up here. 
Codecademy
Codecademy is another online school like Treehouse that runs a variety of coding courses. Codecademy runs courses for 10 different programming languages and has tracks of different lengths. 
The Codecademy material is organized into courses and career paths, where each course or career path set is broken down further into lessons. 
A course might be up to 10 lessons, with the intent that you’ll be able to finish it quickly. A career path might be over 100 lessons and allows you to develop skills to the extent that you can start to work in that field. 
Khan Academy
Khan Academy is a great learning resource that primarily targets kids. Khan Academy will walk you through all of the basics of web development and beyond. 
Khan Academy allows you to work on your coding problem right inside of the Khan Academy workspace. This means you don’t need to learn how to set up a dev environment to start learning with Khan Academy. You can do everything in-browser, where the problems and tasks are well set up for success. This is also available for all Treehouse programs!
MIT OpenCourseWare
MIT OpenCourseWare is a great place to find courses that will teach you a specific skill or language. There are hundreds of courses that target different skills and interests – they offer much more than just computer science. There are also other subject areas such as history, business, and more.
edX
EdX is much like the MIT OpenCourseWare platform. EdX is a huge library of courses and you can sort through them with a variety of filters. You can select courses and earn certificates from major institutions such as Harvard and Yale. Usually taking the course itself is free, and if you want to get a certificate from the institution you can pay a small fee, such as $50 or $100. 
The Odin Project
The Odin Project is a pretty famous full-stack web development track that will take you through from start to finish. You can learn at your own pace, and it’s completely free. You won’t have instructors to help you out with the material, but you can use the community and forums where the course problems might be being discussed.
FreeCodeCamp
FreeCodeCamp is another great coding-focused online platform. You can choose several different tracks of material and it’s all free. There are no real instructors, but the material is maintained by the FreeCodeCamp team so that it stays up-to-date and correct. 
Udemy
Udemy is a fantastic platform for finding learning materials. It’s not coding-focused, but you can find some coding materials there. Udemy will provide you with material of different levels, so you can choose what you want to learn when you want to learn it. The courses on Udemy were written and distributed by community members who made the course. The material wasn’t made by Udemy, but it was approved and published by Udemy.
Coursera
Just like Udemy, Coursera is a great resource for all different kinds of courses. You can find materials for any kind of topic of study there, and you can choose the order and speed of your study. Some courses on Coursera are free, but some cost money. The courses on Coursera were written and distributed by community members who made the course. The material wasn’t made by Coursera, but it was approved and published by Coursera.
Udacity
Udacity is a tech-focused online learning platform. You can choose from a set list of tech-focused programs that Udacity compiled. Unlike Udemy and Coursera, all of the programs on Udacity were written by Udacity. You can graduate with a certificate issued from Udacity.
Start Now!
If there’s ever been a time to learn to code, it’s now. There are hundreds of resources to get you started as well as online courses. You can learn anything, anywhere, any time.

It’s time to get started! But what courses are you going to take? 
Do you want to start with an in-person coding course? Or do you want to get started with an online resource?
