What Programming Language Should I Learn First?
When it comes to starting a Treehouse Techdegree, you might ask what programming language you should first learn.
It’s always best to start with high-level scripting languages — such as Javascript, Python, and Ruby — since they are easy to learn compared to other languages. 
A lot of developers would recommend getting started with Python, which is a back-end programming language.
This is because Python is simple even for beginner coders. It’s easy (easier than Javascript) and reads like English.
But, Python is one-sided and would not do much for aspiring coders interested in front-end development. 
Javascript should be the first programming language you learn.
This is not only because Javascript is currently the most in-demand programming language in the world with almost 70% usage. 

Stack Overflow’s 2020 Survey
Here are five more reasons why Javascript should be the first programming language you learn:
Javascript works for both front-end and back-end development.It can be used alone to build applications while Python can only be used as a part of the development.It provides seamless, endless capabilities during web development while Python is complicated.Node.js in JavaScript makes this programming language remarkably faster than Python.It’s also a high-level scripting language that is easy to learn.
