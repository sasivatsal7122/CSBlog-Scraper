What is a Full-Stack Developer?
A full-stack developer is a professional who is skilled at the development of the front-end (or client-side) and back-end (or server-side) of a website or application. 
As a full-stack developer, it’s essential to understand several coding languages and be able to apply them well.
The term “full-stack developer” was first introduced (and generally referred to as “web development”) by Darcy DiNucci in 1999.
During this time, there wasn’t a major difference between front-end and back-end operations. Developers could develop apps end-to-end and easily build user interfaces.
In 2008, Randy Schmidt defined what full-stack developers meant.
And Google recorded the first search for the term, “full-stack developer,” in 2010.

The search and numbers of web developers have since increased drastically. 
Over the years with advancements in technology, website development has become more complicated. Hence the need to categorize developers into the back-end, front-end, and full-stack.
Today, various survey insights have shown the growth in popularity and numbers of full-stack developers over the years.
This is because more companies are looking for developers who can handle various application sides (front-end and backend) effectively. Hiring a full-stack developer is faster, cost-effective, and more manageable than hiring multiple people. 
LinkedIn’s 2020 report also confirms that the job market for this developer category is drastically increasing. For example, “Full stack engineer” is number 4 on the list of top emerging jobs in 2020 with a 35% annual growth.
Skills Required for Full-Stack Developers
To become competent as a full-stack developer, there are certain skills you need to acquire. These skills for becoming a full-stack developer include:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is a front-end coding language that determines how web pages are structured in the user’s view.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is a front-end programming language that presents the design of an HTML document.Front-end Programming Languages frameworks: You should also know important client-side frameworks and libraries like React, AngularJS, Svelte, jQuery, Vue.js, and Emberjs.Back-end programming languages: Every full-stack developer needs a solid grasp of server-side languages like Java, PHP, C++, Python, Node.js, and Ruby.Back-end Programming Languages frameworks: A server-side developer should understand Django, Ruby, Express.j, Flask, CakePHP, and Ruby on Rails.Javascript: Javascript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) script that is relevant to the development of both the server-side and client-side.Version Control: This is used to track the changes different users make to a software code — without affecting the originality of the project.API Creation and Database Management: As a full-stack developer, you should create Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and manage databases efficiently.Web Structuring: A full-stack developer should have an understanding of the technical and design part — that is, how to create website layouts and designs that improve the UX.

Front End vs. Back End
What are the differences between front-end and back-end?
The front-end is the user interface(UI) — that is, what pops up on the screen when you search a website URL, while the back-end is the server-side that determines the user experience (UX).
Front-end development focuses on creating a seamless UI — website layout, responsiveness, and color pairing and design — on the client side.
The developers who specialize in this are called front-end developers.

Back-end development involves using programming languages to ensure smooth front-end operations. Back-end developers specialize in this function. They are responsible for server set-up, database management, API, and data structuring.

Creating a Career Timeline
Now that you know what it means, how long does it take to become a full-stack developer? 
It usually takes anywhere from three months to one year to become a full-stack developer. However, the deciding factors of how long your studying will be — whether it’s three, six, or 12 months — are:
The type of learning resourcesAvailable timeCommitment to study
The three-month timeline is the minimum amount of time you can spend to learn full-stack properly. Fast-paced learners go into a full-time program and are committed to a back-to-back learning schedule.
However, if you have other things to juggle – like a job or family to take care of— that make you learn on a part-time basis, you can spend between six to 12 months before becoming a full-stack developer.
Note: Once you become a full-stack developer, your learning shouldn’t end. Technical needs are always evolving and that means you need to keep yourself informed of the growth from time to time.
