Title: Flask vs. Django – Which Framework to Learn First?



As a beginning coder, you’ve likely heard that Python is known as one of the easiest programming languages to learn. It has a number of web frameworks to help you build functional and scalable websites and applications. 
Django and Flask are the two most popular web development frameworks that Python developers learn and use:

While these Python-based web frameworks have their unique features and differences, it can still be difficult to know which framework to learn first. Keep reading to learn the differences between Flask vs. Django, and which is best to start learning at the beginning of your coding journey.
What is Flask?
Flask is a lightweight open source Python web framework that enables developers to easily build functional websites and applications.
Flask is a micro-framework written in Python that doesn’t depend on libraries and tools. It has essential functionalities to provide tools for creating applications in the Python programming language.
Here are some features of Flask:
Development server and debuggerCoherent, well-structured APIs  HTTP and RESTful request handlingFlexibility for configurationEasy to deploy in productionOffers integrated support for unit testingUses Werkzeug and Jinja2 dependenciesProvides templates and WSGI supportCompatible with the Google app engineProvides secure support for front-end cookiesHas clear, lightweight documentation

Pros & Cons of Flask
The Python-based web framework, Flask, has several advantages and disadvantages to consider when deciding which to learn first.
Here are some of the pros of the Flask web framework:
Flask is lightweight and easy to useSmall codebaseOffers ease and scalability for simple applicationsProvides support for API generationEffective framework for simple software development and maintenance
Here are some of the cons of the Flask web framework:
Flask has a small community and thus, it can be hard to solve a problem It does not have features to support large application projectsFlask lacks authentication functionality and is less secure than DjangoIt offers no full-stack experience as it lacks high-level development featuresIt also lacks an ORM for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations

What is Django?
Django is a mature open source Python-based web framework for developing high-level software applications.
The Django framework contains libraries and an extensive suite of features for the full-scale development of complex applications.
Because of Django’s complexity, one of it’s well-known design principles is DRY, “Don’t Repeat Yourself.” This means it allows you to easily create unique applications without duplications. 
Here are some features of Django:
Django has a default template engine Offers comprehensive documentationProvides high security and scalabilityIt is versatile and can be used for many types of web applicationsSupports different content formats like JSON, HTML, and XMLOffers support for multiple character encodings and languagesFunctions well with front-end Javascript frameworks like AngularJS and ReactJSSupports multiple databases
Pros & Cons of Django
The full-stack Python-based web framework, Django, also has its own advantages and disadvantages.
Here are the pros of the Django web framework:
Django applications include an optional admin site that allows centralized data managementIt provides secure login functionalityDjango supports ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for CRUD operations and complex database queriesIt provides a mature web development experience through its default template engine and other extensive featuresIt comes with great functionality for creating unique applications with duplicating past projectsDjango (2005) has been around longer than Flask (2010) and has a larger community of people who can provide answers to your questions
The cons of the Django web framework include:
Django is known to have a steep learning curveSome users say it’s too complicated for simple software projectsIt uses a larger codebase sizeDjango functions are dependent on ORM which requires an in-depth understanding
Flask vs. Django: Which is Harder?
Now that you know what these Python frameworks mean and how they function, what about their difficulty levels? 
Which Python-based web framework is harder — Flask or Django?
Because Django is a high-level web framework, it has more learning difficulty when compared to Flask.
This means beginner developers will find exploring Flask to be a more straightforward option than learning Django.

Should I Learn Flask or Django?
It’s a big question, especially if you’re at the beginning of your coding journey.
Django is a mature framework for Python, but it is simple to use. However, it poses more learning difficulties in comparison to Flask’s micro-framework.
While Django is incredibly popular and used amongst experienced developers, beginner developers may have a better learning experience starting with the Flask framework because of its simplicity.
Because of this, we recommend starting with Flask. After learning Flask’s framework, you’ll have the essential programming skills to create functional websites and applications.
Once you feel comfortable with Flask’s framework, you can advance to Django to learn how to develop for more complex software projects.
