Title: Register to Vote! Then, VOTE.



Election Day in the United States is right around the corner. November 3rd, to be exact. At Treehouse, we want to make sure you’ve taken all the steps you need to be registered and able to vote. Every vote is a voice, and we want every voice to be heard. 
Here are some steps to check if you’re ready for voting in person or by mail:

Check to see if you’re registered to vote.
If you aren’t, REGISTER here! Each state has their individual deadlines to vote, so hopefully, it isn’t too late for you.
Once you are registered or were already registered, check where your polling station is. Not everyone votes at the same location, or your state might do mail-in ballots only.
Time to Vote!

Make sure you know what type of voting is offered in your state (in person or mail-in). Due to the pandemic, some states have extended their in-person voting dates.
If your state does a mail-in ballot, then the same site in step 3 will tell you the last date you can send out your ballot. Many states also allow you to hand-deliver your mail-in ballot to the County Clerk, library, or another designated space. 
If you’re a first-time voter, feeling a little nervous, or simply curious about what to expect, here you can see what your ballot will look like.
It’s important to acknowledge our country’s own history around voting which ultimately resulted in the exclusion of underrepresented identities. We must understand these dynamics so we can encourage everyone to vote and prevent barriers for folx.
Here’s some information to learn more about what voting has looked like in the United States.

It is important to ALWAYS vote. We cannot be sometimes voters in order to make an impact. Take this pledge to commit to being a lifetime voter. Make your voice heard. 
Lastly, if you’re interested in helping out at elections and feel safe doing so, you can be a poll worker! This is another excellent opportunity to assist in the election process. 
We hope to see you in the polls, mailing in those ballots, or dropping your ballot off!
