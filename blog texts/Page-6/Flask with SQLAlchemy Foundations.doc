Title: Flask with SQLAlchemy Foundations



Today we released “Flask with SQLAlchemy Basics,” an all-new course from Treehouse instructor Megan Amendola. This 147 minute Python course will teach you how to: Create a website or web app with Flask, connect a Flask website with an SQLite database using SQLAlchemy, create HTML templates, and connect static files.
You should learn Flask because… it’s simple to read and understand, and it’s versatile. It has a wide variety of applications, and supports numerous extensions. Companies like LinkedIn and Pinterest are using the Flask framework for their web applications.
In this article, you’ll learn:

What is Flask?
Flask is a popular Python framework for creating websites and/or web applications. A framework is a collection of code that makes building something easier. Flask will help us to create a website. Because it has written a lot of the code for us, we just need to learn how to use these new tools. Flask helps us work with the request-response cycle. Take a look at what that means with this clip that we shared on Twitter:

A user requests information from your site, your site determines how to handle the request and what information to send back, and then a response is sent to the user. So when a user asks for Treehouse’s homepage, the site will receive the request and send back the homepage’s information.
How to install Flask
Here’s how to create a virtual environment to practice using Flask. You can use whichever IDE (integrated development environment) that you’re comfortable with. Megan uses Visual Studio.

Create a folder for your project
Open your folder in your IDE
Open the terminal in your IDE
Create a virtual environment

Mac: `python3 -m venv env`
Windows: `python -m venv env`


Activate your environment

Mac: `source ./env/bin/activate`
Windows: `.\env\Scripts\activate`


Install Flask

`pip install flask`


Create requirements file

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`



Now your project requirements file is ready if you want to create a repo for this project and others end up wanting to run your project to check it out. If you do want to post this on GitHub, then you can also create a .gitignore file. Inside write env to ignore this folder. Others will only need the requirements file to download the right packages and start your project.
