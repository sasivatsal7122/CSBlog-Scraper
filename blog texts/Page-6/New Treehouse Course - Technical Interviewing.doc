Title: New Treehouse Course: Technical Interviewing



We’re so excited to introduce our newest course, Technical Interviewing! In this hour-long course, Michelle Zohlman will take you through preparation steps and best practices to make sure you’re ready for your first technical interview.
Technical Interviewing will cover a range of what you might experience in a technical interview, since they vary from company to company. You’ll cover whiteboarding, pair programming, portfolio review, and more. This course is the latest addition to our 21st Century Skills topic.

At Treehouse, we believe in holistic job-readiness. We hope this new course will give you the tools you need to rock your first technical interview!
