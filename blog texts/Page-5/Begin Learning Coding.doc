Your Video Intro to Computer Science
In this workshop, students are introduced to fundamental Computer Science (CS) concepts. This workshop unpacks the history of computer science, defines key terms, and identifies common elements across multiple disciplines. After completion, students move forward to foundational workshops in User Experience (UX), Front End Web Development (FEWD), Full Stack JavaScript (FSJS), and Python.
What you’ll learn:

Hello World! Introduction to Computer Science
History of Computers and the Internet

In this workshop, we’ll take a look at the types of code front-end developers write, and even try it out ourselves. But before we do that, let’s take a closer look at the term front-end. Front-end developers are sometimes referred to as client-side developers, since everything we code is directly viewable by the client–in other words, the visitor to our website or app.

Define front-end development
Describe the difference between front-end and back-end development
Use HTML to create web page content
Use CSS to style web page content

What you’ll learn

Backend vs. Front-end development
How to run a Python file
Strings in Python
How to print a string to the console
String formatting
Using Python’s input function
